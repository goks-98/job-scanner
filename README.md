## Troubleshooting

### Scrapers Not Finding Jobs
- Career pages frequently change their structure
- Try running with `-v` for verbose output
- Some scrapers require Chrome to be installed

### Email Not Sending
- Ensure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Check that 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Verify the sender email in settings.yaml
